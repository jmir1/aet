However, instead of attacking Fushi in isolation, Nokkers begin targeting the settlements outside of his reach in hopes of luring him out. Soon, a group known as the Guardians—led by Hisame, the descendant of the deceased warrior Hayase—finds Fushi.\n\nInspired by how Fushi protected Janada Island from the Nokkers years ago, the Guardians have grown a considerable following and are recognized throughout the world. Initially reluctant, Fushi allows the Guardians to accompany him to the site of the Nokkers' recent attack. In their village, Fushi meets a few valuable allies, both new and old. But as the conflict with the Nokkers only leads to more loss, Fushi must find the inner strength to face his inevitable sorrow.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Shounen, Supernatural","status":1,"thumbnail_url":"https://api.animeonsen.xyz/v4/image/210x300/tPMb2Eyb36cASu7K","initialized":true},"passed":true},"episodes":{"result":[{"url":"tPMb2Eyb36cASu7K/video/11","name":"Episode 11: The Value of Flesh","episode_number":11.0},{"url":"tPMb2Eyb36cASu7K/video/10","name":"Episode 10: Resonance","episode_number":10.0}],"passed":true},"videos":{"result":[{"url":"https://cdn.animeonsen.xyz/video/mp4-dash/tPMb2Eyb36cASu7K/11/manifest.mpd","quality":"Default (720p)","videoUrl":"https://cdn.animeonsen.xyz/video/mp4-dash/tPMb2Eyb36cASu7K/11/manifest.mpd","headers":{"referer":"https://animeonsen.xyz","user-agent":"Aniyomi/app (mobile)"},"subtitleTracks":[{"url":"https://api.animeonsen.xyz/v4/subtitles/tPMb2Eyb36cASu7K/en-US/11","lang":"English"}]}],"passed":true}}}]
